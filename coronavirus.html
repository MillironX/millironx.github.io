title: The Problem with Coronavirus
motto: Thoughts on the Coronavirus

<p>
    Under the pretense of saving people from the devistation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV 2019),
    Republicans have justified bribing voters with their own tax money,
    and Democrats have praised the halt of all meaningful activity.
    <b>This power grabbing and fearmongering must come to an end.</b>
    Here are just a few points on how the actions taken in the name of the Coronavirus violate Christian principles.

<p>
    Who are &lsquo;they?&rsquo; The CDC, the WHO, congress, legislatures, city councils, schoolteachers, pastors, your coworkers, your neighbors, that guy you met in the park.
    Anyone who preaches &ldquo;social distancing,&rdquo; and demands compliance with the gods of &ldquo;science falsely so called&rdquo; (I Timothy 6:20, KJV).
    It's time for born&ndash;again believers to ignore the bullies, scoffers, and regulators and reclaim the &ldquo;liberty which we have in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Galatians 2:4, KJV),
    and get out of their homes and work the works of God.

    Still not convinced? Listen to this pastor who's from California (of all places), who has way more skin in the game than I do.

    Oh, and by the way, if there are any web designers reading, please take down the big red banners proving just how much you care about the &lsquo;Rona.
    They're just plain annoying, and I've had to start writing custom uBlock filters to get rid of them.
