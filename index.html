<h2>Milliron X - The homepage of Thomas A. Christensen II</h2>
<p>
    I am an engineer by training, a rancher by upbringing, a techie by experience, and a filmmaker at heart.
    I've got a soft spot for Brown Swiss dairy cows (just in case you couldn't tell by the background image),
    and am sometimes called &quot;one of those crazy, Wyoming dairy cow people.&quot;
    I love anything to do with cattle or technology, but especially anything to do with both of them.

<h3>What is a &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Milliron X&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;?</h3>
<h5>It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_branding">cattle brand</a>, of course! My cattle brand!</h5>
<p>
    <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder">The milliron</span>
    is the bar with a bend in the middle. It does not represent anything physical
    or textual <em>per se</em>, and is therefore a rather unique element in cattle brands.
    Millirons are difficult to modify into another brand, and provide a guarantee of
    authentic ownership.
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder">X</span> is the letter of mystery and
    mystique. For nerds, it's the unknown in any algebra problem. Ranchers and cowboys will associate
    it with big names like the "Bar X" and the "Double X." In either case, it lends itself to a
    sense of withholding, prestige, and power.
</p>
<p>
    Together, these two symbols represent the qualities I strive for in each of my works: authenticity, originality, power, depth, and prestige.

        <p>This is sort of my landing page, but it also doubles as my internet workshop.
            I'm always testing things here that I want to put in other sites I'm working on,
            and its code isn't always the cleanest.
