<p>
    I am licensed in the Great State of Wyoming as a food animal artificial insemination technician, which means I can legally AI cows, goats, and sheep.
    Practically speaking, I have only ever AIed cows, but my conception rates are very good for both beef and dairy cows.
    When (if?) I standardize my rates, I will include them here. Until then, you will have to <a href="Contact">contact me</a> directly and we can negotiate prices then.
